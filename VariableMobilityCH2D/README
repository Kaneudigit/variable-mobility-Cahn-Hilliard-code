The code performs simulation of Spinodal Decompositioin in an isostructural 
binary alloy  and produces results of subsequent bulk-diffusion-controlled 
dynamics and interface-diffusion-controlled dynamics using Variable Mobility 
Cahn-Hilliard equaiton (option is given to the user to determine which one 
to perform, for which, modifications are to be made in VariableCH.c file as 
directed therein).

CONTENTS OF THIS DIRECTORY: -

1. header_file (directory): contains the header file "headers.h" with the 
                            required function prototyes.

2. input (directory):       contains text files for various simulation data required 
                            for simulation. To be altered accordingly depending on 
                            the need of simulation.

3. output (directory):      contains output of a particular run: -
                            a. input data test result
                            b. simulation data  
                            c. the output binary files for various time of evolution 
                            d. PostScript (PS) files displaying the morphological 
                               evolution for each output file.

4. source_code (directory): contains source files, namely: -
                            a. "VariableCH.c", 
                            b. "testcode.c"
                            c. "evolution.c"
                            d. "ps_file.c".
5. Makefile

***********************************************************************************
TO RUN THE CODE: -

For selective compilation, make the following changes in the "VariableCH.c"
program file (as per the demand of the simulation): -

*To implement bulk-diffusion-controlled-dynamics code, keep the comment "//#define INTERFACE" 
 intact (which is present as a comment by default in the source code).
*To implement interface-diffusion-controlled-dynamics code, implement the INTERFACE macro 
 by removing the comment ("//") symbol present before "#define INTERFACE".

If there are ".o" files and the "CH_variable_mobility.out" file present in the parent 
directory, perform the following operations: -
[command for Linux terminal (OS: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS)]

make clean
make CLEAN

To run the code: -

make
./CH_variable_mobility.out

The fresh output of a particular run will be present in the "output" directory.
