# Variable mobility Cahn-Hilliard code
This repository contains C source code for numerical simulation of Cahn-Hilliard equation incorporating compostion dependent variable mobility. The resulting morphology and the coarsening kinetics is dependent in the bulk-diffusion-controlled dynamics and interface-diffusion-control dynamics. Provisions for both have been made in the source code. For more details regarding the execution of the code and implementing the code for two different kinds of dynamics, kindly go through the README file present in the directory.

For more details regarding the governing equations for the algorithm implemented, kindly refer to the paper titled: -
